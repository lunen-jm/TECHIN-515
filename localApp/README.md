# Local App

This app will be the one run by the display device on the individual silo. The app will need to do the following:
* Ingest data transmitted from the sensors
* Analyze data that is transmitted
* Visualize data for the individual silo
* Transmit the data to the cloud

The UI can be basic, and the display could just be basic data on an LED screen if needed
